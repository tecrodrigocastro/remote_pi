/**
 * Stable 8-character hex id for a daemon, derived from the cwd it manages.
 *
 * Derivation: `sha256(realpath(cwd))` truncated to 8 hex chars (32 bits ≈
 * 4 billion). Collision risk is negligible at fleet sizes a single user
 * will ever have (<1000 daemons), and 8 hex characters are short enough
 * to type on the CLI (`/remote-pi send a1b2c3d4 "..."`).
 *
 * Same scheme as `roomIdForCwd` in `src/rooms.ts` — but we use hex
 * instead of base64url so the id has no `_`/`-` (cleaner double-click
 * selection in terminals).
 *
 * Symlinks resolve to a single canonical id via `realpath`, so
 * `/Users/x/Movies` and `/Users/x/link-to-Movies` map to the same daemon.
 * Falls back to the raw path when realpath fails (cwd doesn't exist —
 * shouldn't happen in production but covers test sandboxes).
